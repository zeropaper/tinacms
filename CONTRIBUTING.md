# Contributing to TinaCMS

The following is a set of guidelines and tips for contributing to the TinaCMS and its packages.

## Contributor License Agreement

Before a Pull Request can be accepted, all contributors must sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/tinacms/tinacms). A GitHub Action runs against all Pull Requests to ensure that **all commit authors** on the associated Pull Request have signed the agreement. The contributor license agreement helps us ensure that the code being contributed was written by the contributor and that we have proper license to use the contribution.

## Getting started

Currently this is a monorepo built with Turborepo and PNPM

You _should_ :fingers_crossed: be able to just run these commands. (Please make a note of any hang-ups you ran into during this process)

```sh
# check the node version, 14 or greater is required
node -v
# install pnpm (see docs for other options https://pnpm.io/installation)
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
# ensure you have the latest (at the time of this writing this is 7.4.0)
pnpm -v
# build all the packages
pnpm run build
# watch all packages
pnpm run watch
# in a separate tab, navigate to starter project
cd experimental-examples/tina-cloud-starter
# start the dev server
pnpm run dev
```

That should allow you to see 2 things: The Altair graphql playground at `http://localhost:4001/altair` and the demo app at `http://localhost:3000`. Tina form changes should result in `experimental-examples//tina-cloud-starter/content/marketing-pages/index.md` being changed.

## PR Workflow

All pull requests should include a changeset. To create a changeset, ensure you don't have any uncommitted changes and then run the following command:

```sh
# from the root of the repo
pnpm changeset
```

Choose the package or packages that were affected by your work. _(Tip: you may have to wait a couple of seconds after selecting your packages, sometimes it doesn't get registered and it'll ask you to pick again)_

> Note: You do not need to select packages which _depend_ on changes you made in other packages, the release process will do this automatically for you later on. Just choose packages you worked on directly.

Choose the _type_ of version change they should get. Skipping `major` will ask you if you want to select `minor`, if you skip that it will assume `patch`.

Proceed through the prompts until you have a new `.md` file in the `.changeset` directory. It'll look [like this](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-graphql-gateway/blob/348ef1e57e2e61fb9896d616aabc6f3c85d37140/.changeset/pretty-sloths-return.md)

Feel free to edit this file if you want to alter your messages or which versions will be bumped.

### Commit your changes and push to GitHub and create a PR

The PR will be checked for a changeset file. You're done!

Once the PR is merged and has completed it's actions, you can install the changes by installing the @dev version of the package. So if there were changes to `@tinacms/graphql` merged into `main`, you can test them out by running `pnpm add tina-graphql@beta`.

However, your changes won't yet be published to NPM under the `@latest` tag yet. So without specifying the `@beta` tag, users won't get your latest changes. Instead, when the PR is merged to `main`, another action will kick in. It will create a _separate_ PR which is essentially all of the active changesets in flight. So several merged PRs may result in several pending changesets.

This PR calls `pnpm changeset version`, which _deletes_ changeset files and updates `CHANGELOG.md` files in each package. This PR will stay up to date as new changesets enter the `main` branch. [Here's an example](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-graphql-gateway/pull/316) of what that looks like. Only once this PR is merged will the latest changes be generally available.

### For maintainers: Merge the "Version Packages" PR _back_ to `main`

Previous PRs to main would _not_ have triggered NPM packages to be published because their `versions` haven't been bumped. That's the purpose of the "Version Package" action. So these merges will now have updated `versions`, resulting in publishes to NPM.

## Creating a dev release

Ensure you have created a changeset and have a clean `git` working directory.

Build your changes with `pnpm build`

Run `pnpm version:snapshot`

Run `pnpm publish:dev`

If you have 2FA, this will prompt you to enter you one-time code for each package you publish.

Run `git checkout -- .` This will clear out the versioning changes.

## Working with the GitHub Manager locally

In `packages/@tinacms/graphql/src/index.ts`, replace:

```ts
const manager = new FileSystemManager({ rootPath: projectRoot })
```

with:

```ts
const manager = new GithubManager({
  rootPath: 'experimental-examples/tina-cloud-starter',
  accessToken: '<TOKEN>',
  owner: 'tinacms',
  repo: 'tina-graphql-gateway',
  ref: '<BRANCH>',
  cache: simpleCache,
})
```

Use whichever branch you're currently working with, and generate and provide a GitHub personal access token with full permissions and SSO enabled with tinacms authorized.

## Trying out changes to a package

### Local

If the changes affect local use of the packages (i.e. not the ContentAPI), use the tina-cloud-starter found in the examples directory of this repo. That starter will require a .env file with the following values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_NAME=<ANYTHING YOU WANT>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=<ANYTHING YOU WANT>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_CLIENT=1
```

### Backend

If the changes you want to try out will be in the ContentAPI, then you will need to canary release your package changes. Ask somebody about how to do this.

## Misc

### Getting the starter to reference a different Identity API or ContentAPI

If you've made changes to the ContentAPI or Identity and you want the starter to use the different API, use these override env variables in the tina-cloud-starter:

```
IDENTITY_API_OVERRIDE=<URL TO IDENTITY>
CONTENT_API_OVERRIDE=<URL TO CONTENTAPI>
```

## E2E tests

In order to run the Cypress E2E tests:

1. Build and start the E2E test project
   ```sh
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LOCAL_CLIENT=1
   pnpm build:e2e
   pnpm start:e2e
   ```
2. Run the tests in a separate terminal `pnpm test:dev` or `pnpm test:e2e`
