This allows us to use a leaner `define` function for the standalone config. Right now we're balancing a lot on the `defineSchema/defineConfig` types and have a few overlapping things like `client`, which accepts both an optional object with `referenceDepth` config as well as the autogenerated http client.

One thing it does that's a bit different is it uses the `apiUrl` from the client generation function and sends it through as a global constant to the Vite app, this avoids the need for the generated `client`.
